Aim: to merge edge detection and polygon tracing (potrace) algorithm to produce a raster-to-vector windows application.
</br>
Current progress: edited code to used lapacian matrix for edge detection. No capability to save in SVG format - yet. 
</br>
Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership these codes. I have referenced from these two marvelous sites, http://potrace.sourceforge.net/ and http://softwarebydefault.com/2013/05/11/image-edge-detection/
</br>
Thank you.
