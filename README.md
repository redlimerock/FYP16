Aim: </br> to merge edge detection and polygon tracing (potrace) algorithm to produce a raster-to-vector windows application.
</br>

Current progress: </br> Created branch-1  for editing purposes. </br> Edited code to use only lapacian matrix for edge detection. No capability to save in SVG format - yet. 
</br>

Disclaimer: </br> I do not claim ownership these codes. I have referenced from these two marvelous sites, http://potrace.sourceforge.net/ and http://softwarebydefault.com/2013/05/11/image-edge-detection/
</br>

Thank you.
